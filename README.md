# Arcade Shelf lighting
This is the open pixel control code for the shelf lights in the quelab arcade.
Starting out as just a copy of the lava lamp example from [OPC](https://github.com/zestyping/openpixelcontrol).

The layout file can be used to simulate the shelves to develop other lighting
effects using the opc simulator.

# Running
```bash
python lava_lamp.py -l shelves.json
```
